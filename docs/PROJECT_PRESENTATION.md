# DreamCanvas - Project Presentation Summary

## 🎯 Quick Overview

**DreamCanvas** is an AI-powered image generation platform where users can create stunning images from text prompts and share them with a global community.

---

## 💡 Problem Statement

- Creating custom images requires design skills
- No easy way to share AI-generated art with others
- Need a simple, intuitive platform for image creation

---

## ✨ Solution

A full-stack web application that:
- Generates high-quality images from text using Azure OpenAI DALL-E 3
- Stores and displays community creations
- Provides search and discovery features
- Offers a modern, user-friendly interface

---

## 🏗️ Architecture in 3 Layers

### 1. Frontend (User Interface)
- **React** - Interactive UI components
- **Vite** - Fast development and build
- **TailwindCSS** - Beautiful, responsive design

### 2. Backend (Server & API)
- **Node.js + Express** - RESTful API server
- **MongoDB** - Database for posts and metadata
- **Mongoose** - Database object modeling

### 3. External Services
- **Azure OpenAI** - AI image generation (DALL-E 3)
- **Cloudinary** - Image storage and CDN
- **MongoDB Atlas** - Cloud database hosting

---

## 🔄 How It Works (Simple Flow)

```
1. User enters prompt → "A futuristic city at sunset"
                    ↓
2. Frontend sends request to backend
                    ↓
3. Backend calls Azure OpenAI API
                    ↓
4. AI generates image → Returns base64 data
                    ↓
5. Frontend displays generated image
                    ↓
6. User clicks "Share" → Uploads to Cloudinary
                    ↓
7. Saves to MongoDB → Becomes visible in community
```
